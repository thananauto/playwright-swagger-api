## API Test Generation Prompt using Playwright
**Input File:** Utilize the contents of the `pets.json` file to guide the API test generation using Playwright.

**Client Code:** All client interactions should leverage pre-existing code inside the `Api.ts` file. This file contains all predefined typed functions and types, so ensure you import from there.

**Code Generation:** Avoid generating any code from scratch. Use what's already defined in the `Api.ts` file.

**Assertions:** Implement assertions within the tests using Playwright's expect function to verify response status codes. 

**Import Statements:** Include all necessary modules needed for the tests at the beginning of your test files.

**Test Organization:** Use the test.describe block to group similar types of tests together.

**Endpoint Tests:** For each API endpoint, create a corresponding test file named <endpoint-name>.spec.ts.

**Test File Storage:** Store and save all generated test files in the `tests/api` directory.

**Test:** Generate tests for all collections in the `pets.json` file, and ensure that each test is comprehensive and covers all aspects of the API endpoint.

**Execution:** Run the test and fix any issues that arise during execution

**Fixtures:** Create a separate fixture for initializing the API client and use it across all tests to ensure consistency and reusability.
For example, you can create a fixture like this:

```typescript
import { test as base, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { Api } from '../Api'; // Adjust the import path as necessary

// Create a Playwright fixture for the Api client
export const test = base.extend<{
  apiClient: Api; // Define the type for the fixture
}>({
  // Define the fixture
  apiClient: async ({}, use) => {
    const client = new Api();
    await use(client);
  },
});
```
And then use it in your tests like this:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '../fixtures'; // Adjust the import path as necessary  
test('My API test', async ({ apiClient }) => {
  // Example of using the apiClient fixture in a test
  const response = await apiClient.someApiMethod(); // Replace with actual method
  expect(response.status()).toBe(200); // Example assertion
});
